# 👋 Hi, I'm Eric Voong | @SQLrico

### 📊 Accountant turned Data Analyst & Software Developer
I bridge the gap between **financial precision** and **technical execution**. With a background in managing high-integrity financial datasets and a deep interest in software logic, I specialize in building data stories that drive business decisions.

### 🚀 Technical Toolkit
* **Data Analysis:** SQL (BigQuery, PostgreSQL, SQL Server), R (Tidyverse, ggplot2), Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables)
* **Software Development:** Object-Oriented Programming (Java, Python, C++)
* **Visualization:** Tableau
* **Accounting Core:** Variance Analysis, GL Reconciliation, Inventory Optimization, AP/AR Workflows

### 📂 Featured Projects

#### [🧹 Nashville Housing: Data Cleaning in SQL]([Link-to-Cleaning-Repo](https://github.com/SQLrico/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20%20Queries%20-%20Portfolio%20Project.sql))
**Advanced T-SQL Data Wrangling & Database Optimization**

This project focuses on transforming raw housing data into a clean, usable format for analysis. It showcases my ability to handle real-world "messy" data using high-level SQL techniques.

* **Data Standardization:** Converted varied date formats and standardized categorical fields using **CASE Statements**.
* **Integrity Management:** Utilized **Self-Joins** to populate missing Property Address data by matching Parcel IDs.
* **Structural Parsing:** Used **SUBSTRING** and **PARSENAME** to split complex address strings into individual columns (Address, City, State) for better filtering.
* **Duplicate Removal:** Implemented **CTEs** and **Window Functions** (`ROW_NUMBER`) to identify and delete redundant records, ensuring a unique dataset.

#### [🗄️ COVID-19 Global Data Exploration]([Link-to-SQL-Repo](https://github.com/SQLrico/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Covid%20Exploration%20-%20Portfolio%20Project.sql))
**Advanced SQL Querying & Database Management (PostgreSQL)**

In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of global COVID-19 data to identify infection trends and vaccination progress. 

* **Advanced Techniques:** Leveraged **Joins**, **CTEs**, and **Temp Tables** to merge and manipulate death and vaccination datasets.
* **Rolling Totals:** Utilized **Window Functions** to calculate rolling vaccination counts per country.

#### [🎬 Movie Industry Revenue Analysis]([Link-to-Python-Repo](https://github.com/SQLrico/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Movie%20Correlation%20-%20Portfolio%20Project.ipynb))
**Quantitative Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python**

This project investigates the factors contributing to movie revenue using a dataset of 7,000+ films.

* **Statistical Analysis:** Conducted **Pearson Correlation** analysis and visualized results with **Seaborn Heatmaps**.
* **Data Wrangling:** Handled missing values and used **Regex** to sync release years for accurate time-series analysis.
